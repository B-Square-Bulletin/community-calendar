"""WFIU Community Calendar (Indiana Public Media) via server-rendered HTML.

The listing at https://www.ipm.org/community-calendar is Brightspot HTML with
no JSON/GraphQL/REST API, no RSS/Atom, no iCal/ICS, and no JSON-LD (verified in
the surface research). The only way in is to scrape the server-rendered pages
over plain HTTP -- no browser, no Node, no Crawlee, no new runtime dependency.

The listing is occurrence-expanded: it renders one `ps-promo.PromoEvent` card
per occurrence of a series, so each card becomes exactly one event. The listing
supports a server-side date filter and fixed 10-card pages:

    GET https://www.ipm.org/community-calendar?f1=<startMs>-<endMs>&p=1..N

`f1` is the machine value behind the From/To date pickers (`?from=`/`?to=` are
ignored). This scraper fetches only the pages inside the calendar's Horizon,
reads the rendered `1 of N` to bound paging, and hard-caps the pages it will
walk (failing loud rather than truncating a crawl).

Each unique detail URL is fetched once for the stable `brightspot.contentId`
that keys the UID. WFIU is an aggregator: it loses cross-source dedupe to
direct venue/CVB sources and merges with other aggregators under the existing
binary-tier sort in `scripts/combine_ics.py`/`source_priority.json`.

Usage:
    python scrapers/wfiu_community_calendar.py --output cities/bloomington/wfiu_community_calendar.ics
