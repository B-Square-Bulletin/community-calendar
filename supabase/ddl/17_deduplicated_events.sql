-- Materialized view: deduplicated_events
-- Authoritative deduplicated read model. The confidence route (#150) stores one
-- Merge/Group/Separate decision per listing as events.duplicate_group; this view
-- groups by that stored decision and never recomputes similarity, location, or
-- grouping.
--
-- NULL isolation: a NULL duplicate_group means the route left the row alone and
-- it is its own group. PostgreSQL groups all NULLs together, so each NULL row is
-- keyed by a per-row value ('row:<id>') instead of by the NULL itself.
--
-- Representative: the route persists duplicate_group_representative, so the
-- view presents that member's fields and id. There is no database-assigned
-- min(id) competing rule.
--
-- Refreshed after load-events runs so the app can query pre-deduplicated rows.
