-- Fix REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW deduplicated_events failing with
--   2202E: cannot accumulate arrays of different dimensionality
--
-- The #150 view aggregated the `ics_categories text[]` column with
-- `array_agg`. PostgreSQL builds a rectangular array from the inputs, so a
-- stored duplicate group whose members carry category arrays of different
-- lengths (for example `{Music}` and `{Music,Festival}`) makes the refresh
-- fail. Every consumer then reads a stale or missing decision, and the
-- Generate Calendar workflow fails at the refresh step.
--
-- The view presents one representative per group, so it presents that
-- representative's categories instead of accumulating member arrays. The pick
-- follows the same (rep_rank, id) ordering and "first non-NULL wins" rule the
-- other rolled columns use; it just cannot use `array_agg` over an array.
--
-- This migration supersedes the view definition in
-- 20260923120000_add_duplicate_group_and_route_view.sql. That migration is
-- already applied; the CLI will not re-run it, so the corrected definition
-- ships here.
